Conversation/BrainstormConvos/Line00004=Greetings, I am Broodmother Naktul of the Swarm.  Amon has spawned a new Overmind and has used it to take control of my brood.
Conversation/BrainstormConvos/Line00005=The Overmind must be destroyed before Amon can use it to wrest control of the entire Swarm.
Conversation/BrainstormConvos/Line00007=Warning.  Class X zerg flier detected.
Conversation/BrainstormConvos/Line00008=My queen, I require your aid.  Amon has spawned a new Overmind and has forcibly taken control of the Naktul brood.
Conversation/BrainstormConvos/Line00009=If the Overmind is allowed to reach full maturation, Amon will wrest control of the Swarm from you.
Conversation/BrainstormConvos/Line00012=This outpost divides your fortifications.  Claim it, and you may merge your forces to assault the Overmind.
Conversation/BrainstormConvos/Line00014=A leviathan has been called down by the Overmind.
Conversation/BrainstormConvos/Line00018=The Overmind has birthed a Brutalisk - destroy it!
Conversation/BrainstormConvos/Line00020=Another Brutalisk has been spawned by the Overmind.
Conversation/BrainstormConvos/Line00021=My brood is mine once more.  Never again will Amon corrupt the Swarm!
Conversation/BrainstormConvos/Line00022=You may leave in peace, commander.  The Naktul Brood has no quarrel with you today.
Conversation/BrainstormConvos/Line00023=You may leave in peace, commander; the Naktul Brood has no quarrel with you today.
Conversation/BrainstormConvos/Line00027=Amon's thrall have birthed a pair of Cerebrates to control my brood whilst the fledging Overmind develops its power.  If they are allowed to live, they may attempt to forge a second Overmind after you kill the first one.
Conversation/BrainstormConvos/Line00030=Well done!  A Cerebrate lies dead at your feet, and the nearby zerg have withdrawn from this battle.
Conversation/BrainstormConvos/Line00033=Your efficiency is commendable, commanders; both Cerebrates have been slain, and the risk of a second Overmind has been permanently nullified.
Conversation/BrainstormConvos/Line00034=Amon is testing his pet Overmind by sending minions along with his own forces.  Be ready.
Conversation/BrainstormConvos/Line00035=Slay the Overmind with extreme prejudice, but be wary of the psionic potential of a brain that size against those of lesser beings.
Conversation/BrainstormConvos/Line00124=My queen, my leviathan has been summoned by the Overmind.
Conversation/BrainstormConvos/Line00125=Take care, my queen; there is no telling how much psionic power the Overmind will use against you.
Conversation/BrainstormConvos/Line00126=My queen, the Overmind has birthed a Brutalisk!
Conversation/BrainstormConvos/Line00127=My queen, this base separates you from your ally.  Claiming it for the Swarm will grant both of your forces a foothold against the Overmind.
Conversation/BrainstormConvos/Line00128=My children are yours to command, my queen.
Conversation/BrainstormConvos/Line00129=Both Cerebrates have been annihilated, my queen.  There is no longer a risk of them forging another Overmind.
Conversation/BrainstormConvos/Line00130=A Cerebrate has been slain, my queen, and the zerg it controlled have withdrawn from this battle.
Conversation/BrainstormConvos/Line00131=My queen, Amon's thrall have birthed a pair of Cerebrates to control my brood whilst the fledging Overmind develops its power.  We should not allow them to live and risk further dissention within the Swarm.
Conversation/BrainstormConvos/Line00132=Greetings, I am Broodmother Naktul of the Swarm.  Amon has spawned a new Overmind and has used it to take control of my brood.
Conversation/BrainstormConvos/Line00133=The Overmind must be destroyed before Amon can use it to wrest control of the entire Swarm.

Conversation/BrainstormConvos/Line00138=You may leave in peace, commander.  [Happy]The Naktul Brood has no quarrel with you today.[/Happy]
