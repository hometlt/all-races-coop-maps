Conversation/acObj/Line08001=Commanders. I'm Krythkal, head of the Alysaar. Amon seeks to despoil our Ihan crystals from the Wall of Knowledge.
Conversation/acObj/Line08002=We must return the Crystals to the Warp Conduit before the enemy reaches it. We cannot allow our forbidden lore to fall into the wrong hands again.
Conversation/acObj/Line08006=After the incident with Ulrezaj, I resolved to fortify Ehlna's defenses with Automatons. They're programmed to attack anyone that attempts to retrieve the contents of our archives, including ourselves.
Conversation/acObj/Line08007=The Alysaars are heading to the Wall of Knowledge. Once there, they'll wait until there are no Automatons left. The scholars would be attacked otherwise.
Conversation/acObj/Line08011=The task is finished, Commanders. The Nerazim archives are secured thanks to your efforts.
Conversation/acObj/Line08012=It is done, Commanders. I'll consider the Dominion's debt with the Alys'aril settled.
Conversation/acObj/Line08016=No! All our work! Centuries of memories! They're all lost now!
Conversation/acObj/Line08017=The Warp Conduit is ruined. Destroy the Crystals. Their wisdom is better lost than in the wrong hands.
Conversation/acObj/Line08018=The Conduit has been destroyed. There's nothing more we can do now.
Conversation/acObj/Line08021=Fight without restraint, Commanders. Your opponents are not sentient.
Conversation/acObj/Line08022=Your progress is evident. Keep on.
Conversation/acObj/Line08023=You're getting close. The archive defenses have been decimated.
Conversation/acObj/Line08024=There aren't many enemy forces left. I'm tagging them on your map.
Conversation/acObj/Line08025=Warriors. Do not let fear cloud your convictions. Adun Toridas!
Conversation/acObj/Line08031=The path is finally unguarded. The Alysaar are preparing to return with the Ihan Crystals.
Conversation/acObj/Line08032=The Warp Conduit is online. It must stay intact until the last of the Crystals are safe.
Conversation/acObj/Line08041=The last scholar is heading to the Warp Conduit. It must be protected for just a few more moments.
Conversation/acObj/Line08051=Beware! If the enemy shatters the Warp Conduit, we won't be able to get the Crystals off this moon.
Conversation/acObj/Line08052=If we want to get the Ihan Crystals outside Ehlna, the Warp Conduit must survive.
Conversation/acObj/Line08053=The Conduit is suffering significant damage. It must not fall.
Conversation/acObj/Line08054=The Warp Conduit won't hold much longer. Protect it at all cost.
Conversation/acObj/Line08055=The Warp Conduit is going critical. Hold on soldiers. Our fate depends on it.
Conversation/acObj/Line08061=A Void fissure is materializing. Amon is Invoking a Void Thrasher.
Conversation/acObj/Line08062=The Void Thrasher is focusing its attacks on the Warp Conduit. It must be eliminated.
Conversation/acObj/Line08063=The Warp Conduit is being bombarded by the Void Thrasher. You must stop it.
Conversation/acObj/Line08064=The Void Thrasher will attack the Warp Conduit until it is destroyed. Defending the Conduit is your priority.
Conversation/acObj/Line08065=The Thrasher is no more. We are minutes away from victory.
Conversation/acObj/Line08066=Your armies don't stand a chance against those forces. It is wiser to avoid that strife.
Conversation/acObj/Line08067=The enemy base is heavily fortified. You should not engage it.
Conversation/acObj/Line08068=Your efforts are in vain, commanders. You won't defeat Amon forces in a direct battle.
Conversation/acObj/Line08071=Amon's forces have started advancing towards the archives.
Conversation/acObj/Line08072=The vanguard has been defeated. They withstood the onslaught as long as they could.
Conversation/acObj/Line08073=The automatons won't last much longer. You must proceed with heist.
Conversation/acObj/Line08074=The enemy has nearly reached the Wall. If we don't get there first, we're doomed.
Conversation/acObj/Line08081=There are powerful Khaydarin Crystal formations that could be defiled by the battle. If you can, return them to the Chalice of Memories before it's sealed.
Conversation/acObj/Line08082=Commanders. If you find moments to spare, gather the Khaydarin Crystals and bring them back to the Chalice.
Conversation/acObj/Line08083=The battle threatens the Chalice of Memories. If you don't return the Crystals soon, we will have to seal it for the safety of the rest of them.
Conversation/acObj/Line08084=Excellent. There's a chance for those Crystals to stay intact. The enemy is now focused on the Wall of Knowledge.
Conversation/acObj/Line08085=Schollars. Seal the Chalice of Memories. We cannot risk the fate of our collection any longer.
Conversation/acObj/Line08086=If a worker dies, the gathered crystal is lost. Be careful commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line08090=What are you doing? I did not summoned you here for you to get a tan.
Conversation/acObj/Line08091=Templar! You're desecrating Ehlna! Stop toying around and engage the enemy.
Conversation/acObj/Line08092=That's not a spawning pool! Enough fooling around! Focus!
