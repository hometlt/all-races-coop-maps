Conversation/acObj/Line01996=Commanders. Amon's forces have deployed Death Shards throughout this installation, and they're amassing energy fast. If we don't dismantle them, they'll blow this whole platform out of the sky.
Conversation/acObj/Line01997=Each Shard is sealed behind blast doors, so we'll need some heavy hardware to punch through. Fortunately, this station manufactures Archangel components. If you can round up some of those parts, I'll get you through to the Shards.
Conversation/acObj/Line01998=Thanks for answering my distress call, commanders. Amon's already dug in with his Death Shards, and it's only a matter of time before they're ready to detonate.
Conversation/acObj/Line01999=He has the Shards protected by reinforced blast doors, but I've got an Archangel that'll cut through them easily. She took a beating in her last fight, so we'll need to salvage some parts for repairs from around the station.
Conversation/acObj/Line02000=There's an automated rail network that ships components from salvage to manufacturing. We should crack open some of those cargo wagons and use the parts for the Archangel.
Conversation/acObj/Line02001=Here comes another shipment of hardware. Get out there and intercept it.
Conversation/acObj/Line02002=Another train is scheduled to arrive topside soon. Bring me back a souvenir.
Conversation/acObj/Line02003=We've got another train coming. Do what you've gotta do -- just be gentle with the hardware.
Conversation/acObj/Line02004=Good, I can work with this. Keep those parts coming.
Conversation/acObj/Line02005=Even this scrap and salvage can be turned into raw firepower -- everything's a weapon if you try hard enough.
Conversation/acObj/Line02006=First rule of Terran engineering: putting more guns on your ride is always an improvement.
Conversation/acObj/Line02007=You're making good progress out there. Just a bit more of that hardware and I'll be combat-ready.
Conversation/acObj/Line02008=Archangel repairs are just about finished. Keep your eyes peeled for more of those parts.
Conversation/acObj/Line02009=Isn't she a beauty? I've just got a few finishing touches to make before we launch.
Conversation/acObj/Line02010=Heads-up, commanders. That Death Shard is halfway primed to blow.
Conversation/acObj/Line02011=We're running out of time. We need to finish the Archangel before that Death Shard explodes
Conversation/acObj/Line02012=If we don't hurry up with repairing the Archangel, we're going to find out the hard way why they call them 'Death Shards.'
Conversation/acObj/Line02013=Running out of time, commanders. Finish off that Death Shard!
Conversation/acObj/Line02014=Archangel online and moving out!
Conversation/acObj/Line02015=Did somebody order a 600-ton neosteel death machine?
Conversation/acObj/Line02016=Time to move! They're DEFINITELY going to know what hit 'em.
Conversation/acObj/Line02017=Archangel's ready to go. You mind setting me up for another big entrance?
Conversation/acObj/Line02018=All right. You know the drill: you lead the way, and I'll bring the light show.
Conversation/acObj/Line02019=Repairs complete. Just need one more favor: clear the landing zone in front of the blast doors. I'll be ready to deploy on your signal.
Conversation/acObj/Line02020=Knock, knock!
Conversation/acObj/Line02021=You can't hide from me!
Conversation/acObj/Line02022=Open up!
Conversation/acObj/Line02023=Your flyers got over the blast doors, but they can't take down the Shard alone.
Conversation/acObj/Line02024=Careful near those Death Shards, commanders. Best we tackle this one together.
Conversation/acObj/Line02025=Taking heavy damage, ejecting! Finish that thing off for me!
Conversation/acObj/Line02026=Gotta back off. Keep up the pressure!
Conversation/acObj/Line02027=My Archangel! Commanders, make them pay for that!
Conversation/acObj/Line02028=That...was satisfying. The Archangel did her job beautifully, but we'll need another round of repairs before she's ready for her next fight.
Conversation/acObj/Line02029=Nicely done, commanders. That thing scratched up my ride pretty good, but she's not down for the count. Track down some more of those parts so I can bring the Archangel back online.
Conversation/acObj/Line02030=I'll never get tired of that. One more Death Shard to go before we can call this a win.
Conversation/acObj/Line02031=It seems the 'dark god' didn't bring big enough guns. Amon's forces are in full retreat. It was a pleasure fighting alongside you, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line02032=Nothing left to shoot at? Huh... I didn't expect to feel so... disappointed. But that's a win for all of us -- the facility is clear. Couldn't have done it without you.
Conversation/acObj/Line02033=We're overrun, the facility is lost. This isn't over, Amon -- mark my words!
Conversation/acObj/Line02034=We're out of time -- that Death Shard is ready to blow. We need to evac, now!
