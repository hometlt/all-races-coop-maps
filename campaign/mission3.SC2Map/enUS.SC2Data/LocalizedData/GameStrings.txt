HybridCynosure=
LoadingScreen/TextBody=Prior to the great war, the farthest outskirts of the Koprulu sector were locked in an endless, indecisive conflict, not by the Zerg and Protoss, but a pair alien factions that had gone completely unnoticed throughout even the Broodwars: The Keiron (a singular Hivemind entity known as Kerion) and The Xayid (which are in fact in no way descended from Zerg, probably plants or something)<n/>However, Amon cared not for their petty squabbles, and in his quest to recreate every inch of the sector in his own image, Keiron and The Xayid were left decimated. <n/>With over 70% of their population wiped out, Keiron and the Xayid were forced to put their differences aside, lest they risk extinction.<n/><n/>Now, even years after Amon's defeat, the two races still suffer from the effects of the great war, busy cleaning up after the countless Zerg and Terrans that once ravaged their homes. Over the ages on an isolated planet, they have recruited numerous outcasts to bolster their numbers; from dragons, refugees, to Hybrid that broke free after Amon's death, and now the Scavenger faction of the USG's.<n/><n/>The Genetron are determined to finish off Cruith for any information he may have, but he won't be so easily defeated by a slave of the Confederacy.<n/>
LoadingScreen/Tip=The planet's inhabitants are currently asleep. You'll have 3 minutes to cripple a base before they react.
