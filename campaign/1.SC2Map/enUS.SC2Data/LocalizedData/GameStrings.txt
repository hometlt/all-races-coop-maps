LoadingScreen/TextBody=<c val="00FF00">Huge thanks to Dima making these maps, Mah Lawn for writing all these openings, Solstice for the Scion mod, and Visceroid for helping me with getting mods to work, and for being very patient with me. </c><n/>Long before even the Broodwars, the Confederacy had made plans to keep themselves in power should anyone dare to threaten their rule. It was called the Genetron Program, a force of autonomous machines loyal to only the Confederacy, undergoing development via remote drones so far out in the edges of the Koprulu sector that not even the Protoss would have detected them. Alas, the Confederacy had already succumbed to corruption and negligance long ago, and the project's growth was stunted by the necessary funds being diverted into the pockets of its creators instead.<n/><n/>When Mengsk had showed up, the Confederates realized their mistake and rushed to finish it in time as a last resort to save themselves. But it was too little, too late, and mere moments before its completion, the Genetron Program lost contact with the defeated Confederacy. Now, the machines lay dormant on planet Muninn, still waiting even years after Amon's defeat for the sole purpose of crushing the Dominion. They could not save the Confederacy from its own hubris, so they'll settle for revenge in their long dead masters' steed.<n/><n/>Dev Note: This campaign is difficult.. So long as you can micro you'll be fine. But if you can't, you have been warned.

Param/Value/1560E99C=<c val="80FF80">The Genetron use a Energy Mechanic to produce units at a quicker rate. If your energy runs out (top right of screen) then you will not be able to produce anything until more energy is provided.</c>
Param/Value/20981695=Guide to Genetron (by Mah Lawn)<n/>Genetron are a faction that look like Terran but behave nothing like them, with all units and structures being mechanical. The Genetron revolve around a third resource known as Power, which is created by the Node and the Generator, while stored by the Processing Core and the Relay Tower (Generator stores a little bit too). Power is a global mechanic, used by all of your production structures to speed up their rate of production. Nearly all of your units require Power for their abilities as well, and will need Relay Towers or the flying batteries known as Processors to constantly recharge them. Your rate of gaining Power can be increased by building more Nodes and Generators, while Relay Towers and Processing Cores increase your total energy storage. Whatever you do, do not let your Power run out. The Genetron also rely on their powerful abilities and swarm tactics. <n/>Some other facts about Genetron:<n/><n/>Turrets can burrow. You can auto-cast it and it will unburrow whenever an enemy is near.<n/><n/>When Genetron Structures get low on hp, they will "shut down" and will disable themselves. They take reduced damage and have a lower attack priority, but can't function until you repair them. <n/><n/>Structures you "Warp in" will slow down if attacked during the warp-in process. <n/><n/>Blazes are designed to be a front-line tank. They deal low damage, but get take a lot of damage before going down.<n/><n/>The Aquilla is a good unit.

Param/Value/CAD017D5=Welcome to the campaign! This campaign is difficult, however the campaign has been designed in a way where you can pretty much use anything and still win.<n/>Each mission will have these little tips. These will give overviews of the enemies, some hints about the mission, and a fun fact.</c><n/>Fun Fact: Originally when this campaign first came out the player had every unit unlocked. The problem? Everyone just made capitol ships, and mission design was restricted because of it.. <n/>Alright, lets get to the enemy parts (Also future tips like this wont be as "rambley") <n/><n/>Enemy Tactical Analysis:<n/><n/>Purple( the USG player at the center of the map) is the main threat. He will train light infantry and later on will train a more tank focused army. <n/>His base does not have much in the way of production as his main base only contains 1 Teleportation Pad (it's a thing that makes USG units), so you may want to look around as there might be a way to cripple him without engaging him directly (HINT HINT).<n/><n/>Green( the USG player to the East) resides in the caves. He focuses on light attacks that will be farried by transports. However, his army seems more passive then the others, you may be able to avoid him until later. His base is connected to a back entrance to Purple's base.<n/><n/>Red (the USG Commander (Cruith) to the NorthEast) resides on a cargo boat and can not be attacked. He will send out air raids, with a small amount of infantry. Do not worry about him, your main focus is the other 2 targets.<n/><n/><n/>Your ally (Teal) is of no concern. They will warn you once your enemy moves out.<n/><n/><n/><c val="00FF00">PS: Some units and abilities were also re-added to the faction. Also, units in this campaign are upgraded from their melee counter parts.The reason I did this was to make the Genetron's units fill a specific role that they do really well in. I don't want a unit that's like the predator where you make it once then never touch it again. For instance, the Blaze was removed from melee because it was a bad unit and wasn't viable unless you were fighting zerg. But in this campaign, the Blaze has increased health, shield, and armor, making it very good at soaking against things like siege tanks and other anti-armor units as it is light. </c><n/><n/>Enjoy!
