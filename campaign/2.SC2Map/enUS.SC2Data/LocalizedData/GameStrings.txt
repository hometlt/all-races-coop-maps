LoadingScreen/Subtitle=A Purpose
LoadingScreen/TextBody=Following the disastrous contact with the unmanned forces, Commander Cruith of the USG has fled across the ice planet and sought sanctuary with a group of Umojans working for the Dominion. Normally, due to their affiliation, they would have crushed Cruith right then and there. But since the Umojans were about to leave, and didn't feel like wasting their time on an enemy that didn't want to fight, they begrudgingly let the USG stay, so long as they caused no trouble.<n/><n/>Trouble however, was coming. Not from the USG, but from the Genetron, who, following the recent activation of aerial forces, have managed to follow the USG back to the Umojan fortress. With this new development, the Umojan have more than just some annoying guests to deal with.
LoadingScreen/Tip=You will be given vision of your enemy at the start. Use this to plan your attack.

Param/Value/0A3C7B27=Fun fact: This was the 9th mission I made.<n/>Tactical Analysis:<n/><n/>Purple (the Umojan terran to the Northwest and in the center of the map) trains basic infantry. Her main focus however, is harrassing you. While her armies are not enough to beat yours in a fight, she will try to slow you down. Pay attention to movement on the minimap. <n/><n/>Red (The USG commander known as "Cruith) resides to the North of the map. He will take a while to build up his base. Once his base is opperational, he will deploy the same tactics as the last mission, Strike Fighters with basic infantry.<n/><n/>Whirlwind: There is an experimental Whirlwind unit to the Northwest. Once it becomes opperational, it will siege your units and base anywhere on the map. It's one weakness is that it requires a spotter to shoot. The Umojan know this and will deploy spotters around your base to give it vision. Your Processors will reveal any burrowed or cloaked spotters he may have hid.<n/><n/>There are several Genetron units scattered around the map, finding them will unlock new units for you such as the Tesla and the Uploader. <n/><n/>Incitor: A high mobility unit capable of jumping up and down cliffs. Great for hit and run tactics.<n/><n/>Tesla: The Shock Charge abilitiy is great at killing swarms of low hp units. The Stealth Charge can be used through getting through chokes, as well as avoiding the Whirlwind's gaze.<n/><n/>The Umojan base has several entrances, because you have vision of their base at the start, look around, you might find something useful.
Param/Value/0CD195AC=<c val="00FF00">The Whirlwind will not be active until 10 mins have passed. Once it becomes opperational, it will siege your units and base anywhere on the map.

Param/Value/B6C28073=So, question, from the rumors I heard you Dominion got your arses kicked by the Kerion. 
Param/Value/BDD8F2A0=Shadow Guard
Param/Value/C1951AFB=Many years after the Great War, Valerian sent out an expedition force to help those who had been affected by Amon's wrath. The idea was that the Dominion would be able to form alliances with those outside of the Kopurlu Sector, This was done to increase the Dominion's safety in case a Amon-level threat occurred again.<n/><n/>However, the expedition hit a snag when Dominion General Krookov discovered that the Kerion and Xaylid were harboring Hybrid who had broken free from Amon's will. Krookov demanded that the Hybrid be executed for the death of the many brave men and woman of the Dominion who died fighting Amon. The Kerion and Xaylid refused and Krookov declared this sector hostile.<n/><n/> After a few bloody battles that saw the death of over half the Expedition force. The expedition was forced back once it became apparent that these factions weren't going to surrender.<n/><n/>Krookov has issued orders for all Dominion Commanders to converge at Silorus, the central staging point for the ongoing conflict, as they prepare to return to the Kopurlu Sector.<n/>Despite the Dominion being in full retreat, the Kerion and Xaylid continue to fiercely push back, often ensnaring retreating Dominion forces. The Xaylid, a zerg-like species (or plant-like, depending on when you're reading this in) began a massive campaign of recapturing territory from the Dominion.. However, due to Krookov's hurried withdrawal, some commanders were left unaware of the evacuation order until just moments before the fleet's scheduled departure within the week. Commanders like Piera received last-minute notifications, forcing her to scramble and ensure the safety of her troops.<n/><n/>In the midst of this turmoil, local scavengers capitalized on the chaos and began scavenging whatever was left behind by the Dominion. One such group, the USG, took advantage of the situation. Despite their strained relationship with the Kerion, they formed an alliance based on a mutual agreement. The terms were clear: the (USG), as part of the agreement, would have the freedom to salvage any remaining technology, on the condition that they refrained from interfering with the Kerion's operations. In return, the USG would join forces with the Coalition, aiding in the sector's reconstruction, and help with the years of Amon's devastating rampage.
