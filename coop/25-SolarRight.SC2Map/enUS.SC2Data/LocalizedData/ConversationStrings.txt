Conversation//Line=Greetings Commanders, we were performing archeological reseach over at Qha Dan's Temple, but a few hours ago Amon attacked us, and forced us to evacuate the research station. It is very important that we get to the Temple with enough Solarite before Amon's army does.
Conversation/SolarRight/100Per= We did it! Good job commanders!
Conversation/SolarRight/25Per=Thats a good start. But we're nowhere close yet. Keep gathering! 
Conversation/SolarRight/50Per= We're halfway there! Keep collecting more solarite!
Conversation/SolarRight/75Per= Good job! We're almost there!
Conversation/SolarRight/AboutToLeave=My team is getting ready to depart. We'll be heading for the first research facility soon.
Conversation/SolarRight/AlmostLeaving1st= We have all we need now. We're moving out soon.
Conversation/SolarRight/AlmostLeaving2nd= My team is getting ready to keep going.
Conversation/SolarRight/AlmostLeaving3rd= Almost there, get ready for the last push!
Conversation/SolarRight/Amon25Per= My intel tells me amon is a quarter of the way there.
Conversation/SolarRight/Amon50Per= Looks like amon is half way there! Hurry up commanders!
Conversation/SolarRight/Amon75Per= Amon has almost gathered all the solarite he needs! We can't let him get there first!
Conversation/SolarRight/BonusAlert=  My team said they saw a... small.. flying statue in this area. Can you please check that out for me?
Conversation/SolarRight/BonusComplete= Good job! What a curious thing that was. My team will bring it to the base so we can research it.
Conversation/SolarRight/BonusFailed= We have no more time for that thing. Let's finish what we came here for.
Conversation/SolarRight/BonusRemind= The energy readings keep going up, you should really take a look.
Conversation/SolarRight/BonusRemindLast= If you don't go and check out the statue soon it will be too late.
Conversation/SolarRight/DefeatSOLARITE= No! The temple gates are being sealed.
Conversation/SolarRight/DefeatTRUCK= This is not good. We've lost the truck, and with it, our only chance at reaching the temple.
Conversation/SolarRight/EnemyGathers= Look. The enemy is sending his workers to gather solarite. We could gain more time if we take them down.
Conversation/SolarRight/FirstStop= Hurry up people! We have to find those plans as soon as possible.
Conversation/SolarRight/Intro=Greetings commanders. We were performing archaeological research over a Qhadan's temple. But a few hours ago, Amon attacked us and forced us to evacuate the research stations. It's very important that we get to the temple with enough solarite before Amon's army does.
Conversation/SolarRight/LeaveStart= Is everyone in the truck? Then let's go. There's no time to waste.
Conversation/SolarRight/Leaving1st=We're ready to go! Moving out!
Conversation/SolarRight/Leaving2nd= Moving out in a second!
Conversation/SolarRight/Leaving3rdStop= Leaving for the temple now!
Conversation/SolarRight/Objective1=As any ancient Protoss technology, the Temple Gates require Solarite to be opened. Luckily the planet is full of the stuff. Bring it back to our convoy and we'll handle the rest.
Conversation/SolarRight/Objective2= We were able to gather some, but we're still missing (target number) pieces to have enough energy. Your enemies are harvesting the resource too. If we don't do anything to stop them, they will have the required amount to get inside soon.
Conversation/SolarRight/ReachTempleBeforeSol= We still need more solarite before we can open the gates.
Conversation/SolarRight/SecondStop= We'll begin refueling the truck.
Conversation/SolarRight/ThirdStop= This will be our last break! We'll be moving again soon.
Conversation/SolarRight/TruckAttack= I don't get why I always get mixed up with these extreme powerful entities. I should have studied arts.
Conversation/SolarRight/TruckAttack2= Commanders, it seems like the truck is getting destroyed. Please keep it alive.
Conversation/SolarRight/TruckAttack3= Someone hand me the fire extinguisher? It's heating up in here.
Conversation/SolarRight/TruckLow= The truck is about to be destroyed. We need your help RIGHT NOW!
Conversation/SolarRight/TruckNearDeath= If you don't assist the truck now it will be destroyed!
Conversation/SolarRight/Victory=Extraordinary! I thank you commanders, we'll take over from here.

Conversation/acObj/Line07047=As most ancient Protoss technologies, the Temple Gates can only be powered with solarite. Luckily, there are plenty of nodes from where your workers can collect it. The processor in your base can turn it into energy.
Conversation/acObj/Line07048=As any ancient Protoss technology, the Temple Gates require Solarite to be opened. Luckily the planet is full of the stuff. Bring it back to our convoy and we'll handle the rest.
Conversation/acObj/Line07049=We were able to gather some, but we're still missing (target number) pieces to have enough energy. Your enemies are harvesting the resource too. If we don't do anything to stop them, they will have the required amount to get inside soon.
Conversation/acObj/Line07050=We were able to harvest some, but we still need you to gather some for us. Your enemies are harvesting the resource too, we need to stop them.
