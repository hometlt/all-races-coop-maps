Character/Attitude/AdmiralAlexandrov=calm, excessively formal

Character/Name/AdmiralAlexandrov=Admiral Alexandrov

DOCSTR_Transmission_AeriesArrive=Commanders, our weapon systems are still offline, and this Hybrid abomination is after us. You will have to deal with it yourself. Be vigilant. Sensor data suggests it is extremely dangerous.
DOCSTR_Transmission_AeriesDead=It is done. Hybrid forces will have a hard time recovering from that loss… We are in your debt, Commanders. But with these Concord cannons and Retribution launchers we are going to repay it soon enough. Captain, plot the course for the frontline. We're bringing some heavy ordnance to bear.
DOCSTR_Transmission_BayClaimed=You have captured one of the Docking Bays. The Shuttles are ready to resupply us. Just use the Control Tower to let them know what you need.
DOCSTR_Transmission_BaysActive=Amon's Forces are using Docking Bays to bring in reinforcements and launch direct attacks upon Galatea. Recapture them, if you can. I will then call in Supply Shuttles to replenish our resources.
DOCSTR_Transmission_BonusA_Arrive1=Our engineers have managed to integrate a Portable Phase Forge into a Marauder chassis. This prototype is called 'Devastator Battlesuit'. Amon's forces will try to use it in the war. Please, destroy it before that happens.
DOCSTR_Transmission_BonusA_Arrive2=Avoid approaching the Battlesuit with air units. Its 'Retribution' missile system easily turns a small fleet into dust. If I were you, I would use a medium group of fast ground units to take it down.
DOCSTR_Transmission_BonusA_Complete=It pains me to see the fruits of our work destroyed. But I'd rather destroy it myself than see Amon's thralls using it against us. Then again, my specialists will rebuild it eventually.
DOCSTR_Transmission_BonusA_Expired=Energy signatures from the Devastator Battlesuit have vanished. It is horrible for a scientist to see his weapon used against his kin. I wish I had destroyed it before, when I had the chance.
DOCSTR_Transmission_BonusA_ExpiryWarning=Amon is sending in a recovery team to take away the Devastator Battlesuit. We should move now to prevent it.
DOCSTR_Transmission_BonusB_Arrive1=Several months ago we found a pair of Colossi inside a malfunctioning Warp Prism. Our engineers mounted their Thermal Lances onto Battlecruisers, Prometheus and Firebird. Amon now has the cruisers. I am asking you to destroy them before they can escape.
DOCSTR_Transmission_BonusB_Arrive2=There is an important thing you should know about these vessels: we were forced to dismount all of their ATA Laser Batteries. So, they can only rely on Wraith escorts in case of an air attack.
DOCSTR_Transmission_BonusB_Complete=Scans confirm the battlecruisers are down. Judging by their firepower, you have just saved a planet or two. But the loss of the unique Thermal Lance prototypes is upsetting nonetheless.
DOCSTR_Transmission_BonusB_Expired=I have lost contact with Prometheus and Firebird. I can only hope our allies will recognize the threat in time to prevent the devastation.
DOCSTR_Transmission_BonusB_ExpiryWarning=I am reading energy surges coming from our star dock. It seems, Prometheus and Firebird are preparing to initiate a warp jump. You should hit them now, Commanders.
DOCSTR_Transmission_Damage1500=Commanders, we are going critical. Unless the perimeter defense is established soon, we are not going to hold.
DOCSTR_Transmission_Damage2500=Neosteel Plating has sustained considerable damage. Some of auxiliary systems are down. We are relying on your forces. Please, repel the assault.
DOCSTR_Transmission_Damage4500=Galatea has sustained some damage. Engineering teams are maintaining system stability, but we should avoid harming it further. Please, station additional forces at the Capital Shipyard.
DOCSTR_Transmission_Damage500=Commanders, commence the evacuation. We are never going to make it.
DOCSTR_Transmission_Start1=Greetings, Commanders. Admiral Alexandrov here. I am in charge of this Experimental Shipyard. Amon's army is now invading the facility, and we're hopelessly outnumbered.
DOCSTR_Transmission_Start2=We are intended to launch our most important prototype: the Galatea Dreadnought. But as long as the Ion Cannon on the main platform is online, we are forced to stay grounded.
DOCSTR_Transmission_Start3=My garrison has been decimated, so I need your help to bring that Ion Cannon down. Initiating mission data transfer, now.
