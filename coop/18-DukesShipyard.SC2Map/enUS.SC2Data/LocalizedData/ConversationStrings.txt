Conversation/acObj/Line01070=Normally, I would've take care of this problem myself, but they have killed my men and deactivated my fleet. Our objective is to recapture the Capital Ships.
Conversation/acObj/Line01996=Greetings, Commanders. I'm General Hammond Duke of the Terran Dominion. Now in the time it took y'all to make your way over here, Moebius have taken control of my shipyard.
Conversation/acObj/Line01997=Ships are coming online, Commanders. Make sure my Pilots reach them soon.
Conversation/acObj/Line01998=Stay sharp, Commanders. Moebius is sending out a kill team to patrol the platform. Y'all not going to want to mess with them.
Conversation/acObj/Line01999=Who called in the fleet?
Conversation/acObj/Line02000=Looks like y'all pissed Moebius off 'cause another patrol is dropping in. Security's getting tight.
Conversation/acObj/Line02001=Don't be throwing away my Pilots, now. I ain't got a lot of 'em.
Conversation/acObj/Line02002=My ships are in good condition. Next one's activating soon.
Conversation/acObj/Line02003=Warning. Main objective approaching failure point.
Conversation/acObj/Line02004=Normally, I would've take care of this problem myself, but they have killed my men and deactivated my fleet. Our objective is to recapture the Capital Ships.
Conversation/acObj/Line02005=Now I can reactivate them for only a few minutes. You'll be provided with Pilots to escort to the ships themselves. They will take them for necessary repairs. Don't expect them to stick around.
Conversation/acObj/Line02006=Well now, Commanders, looks like the Dominion docked a couple Gorgon Battlecruisers for us. I suggest you take 'em with a pair of Pilots when you get the time. Keep an eye out for hostiles 'cause it'll take a minute to start their engines.
Conversation/acObj/Line02007=I got one last pilot to send. Either y'all change tactics or I'll change Commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line02008=Like a charm, Commanders! That Gorgon is live! Now let's see her in action.
Conversation/acObj/Line02009=Not only did ya cost me my shipyard, but now my fleet's gone too. I ain't gunna forget this, Commanders. Y'all failed me.
Conversation/acObj/Line02010=I'm impressed, Commanders. There were a few errors, but I got my fleet back. Consider yourselves pardoned for that initial delay.[/Angry]
Conversation/acObj/Line02011=Good work, Commanders, Gorgon's activating now. Let's see what ol' Norad IV can do.
Conversation/acObj/Line02012=Gorgon online, Commanders. I think I'm beginning to like you guys. 
Conversation/acObj/Line02013=Be careful! I only got a handful of Pilots. Each man counts!
Conversation/acObj/Line02014=You wastin' my pilots, Commanders? I ain't got many to spare.
Conversation/acObj/Line02015=Get ready to move, Commanders. More ships are activating now.
Conversation/acObj/Line02016=Activating ships now. Make sure you capture them.
Conversation/acObj/Line02017=Ships are coming online and my pilots are on their way. Get my ships back, Commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line02018=Moebius' getting antsy; another patrol is dropping in. Keep an eye out for 'em.
Conversation/acObj/Line02019=That's more ships for my fleet. Y'all got a minute before the next ones are ready.
Conversation/acObj/Line02020=Additional ships received. Look for the next ones shortly.
