Conversation/RelicofTwilight/Line00001=Commanders. The zerg pour into Shakuras from Aiur, and Amon seeks an old khaydarin void emitter to unleash upon the Spear of Adun.
Conversation/RelicofTwilight/Line00002=The void emitter draws power from the region's conduits in cycles. Your forces must hold a position on each priming conduit, disrupting the transfer of energy.
Conversation/RelicofTwilight/Line00008=We have augmented your units with psionic disruptors. As long as one of you remains close to a priming conduit when it transfers energy, your units will attempt to disrupt it.
Conversation/RelicofTwilight/Line00010=A successful disruption! The weapon's systems are beginning to degrade, commanders. Continue your efforts until it lies a metal husk!
Conversation/RelicofTwilight/Line00011=We've been hit! Gods be good, it.. Commanders, it is of paramount importance that you prevent any more conduits from activating..
Conversation/RelicofTwilight/Line00012=You've almost crippled it! Let not your resolve falter, commanders. The void emitter seems to fracture before unleashing its wrath!
Conversation/RelicofTwilight/Line00013=The Spear of Adun will break under further assault! Commanders, you are our only shield against this weapon. We cannot fail those still on Shakuras!
Conversation/RelicofTwilight/Line00014=Scanners have identified the defense matrix hub at the southeastern edge of the void emitter.
Conversation/RelicofTwilight/Line00015=Transferring its control to the Spear of Adun would be beneficial, however it is enraptured with a dangerous biological anomaly. Many lives may be lost in the endeavor.
Conversation/RelicofTwilight/Line00016=Excellent. We've begun linking the matrix to the psionic grid. The disintegrator array should be online shortly.
Conversation/RelicofTwilight/Line00017=The swarm that traverses the inner complex will no longer move unharmed.
Conversation/RelicofTwilight/Line00018=Amon sends his brood to interfere. End their wretched lives!
Conversation/RelicofTwilight/Line00020=A large host of zerg are set to assail your forces at the conduit, commanders. Act in unison to hold your position!
Conversation/RelicofTwilight/Line00021=Amon stalls one of the conduits! Rally your forces - greater numbers shall seize it!
Conversation/RelicofTwilight/Line00022=Anht zagatir nas, commanders... We embrace oblivion.
Conversation/RelicofTwilight/Line00023=It is done! Your efforts have saved countless lives, commanders. The Nerazim are eternally grateful.
Conversation/RelicofTwilight/Line00024=Bolster your armies and prepare to move as soon as possible. The Spear of Adun must not be harmed.
Conversation/RelicofTwilight/Line00025=A vile creature bombards your forces! Quickly, move your units away from the conduit!
Conversation/RelicofTwilight/Line00026=Zerg are on the move... Hold fast commanders, they seek to halt your efforts!
Conversation/RelicofTwilight/Line00027=An attack force comes to prevent your disruption, commanders!
Conversation/RelicofTwilight/Line00028=Amon presses his attack! Beware commanders - the brood mobilizes to contest the conduits!
Conversation/RelicofTwilight/Line00029=A conduit has been stalled! Gather your units and hold the area at all costs!
Conversation/RelicofTwilight/Line00030=A conduit is contested! Quickly, dispatch all zerg and secure it with your forces!
Conversation/RelicofTwilight/Line00031=Multiple conduits have begun priming, commanders. I suspect they will only increase in number with each cycle. You must both either work together or separate to secure each.
Conversation/RelicofTwilight/Line00032=The conduits are minutes away from powering the void emitter, commanders. I advise you venture out now to secure them.
Conversation/RelicofTwilight/Line00033=Be wary. The zerg hive cluster in this region is well fortified.
Conversation/RelicofTwilight/Line00034=A single conduit? Something is not right, commanders.. Gather upon it with your combined forces. Do not expect Amon's brood to relent!
Conversation/RelicofTwilight/Line00035=The behemoth fires upon your forces! Evacuate the area!
Conversation/RelicofTwilight/Line00036=An incoming bombardment targets your forces!
Conversation/RelicofTwilight/Line00037=The bile citadel flings filth upon your forces!
Conversation/RelicofTwilight/Line00038=A payload of bile is inbound to a conduit! Evacuate any units in the area!
Conversation/RelicofTwilight/Line00039=A bombardment is imminent upon a conduit! Avoid its hail of death!
Conversation/RelicofTwilight/Line00040=The beast expels liquid death upon a conduit! Stay clear of its hellfire!
