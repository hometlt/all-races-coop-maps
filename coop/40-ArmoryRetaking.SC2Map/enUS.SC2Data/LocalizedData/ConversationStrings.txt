Conversation/acObj/Line01996=Greetings, commanders. Amon has occupied the Valhalla installation and tried to strengthen the hybrid.
Conversation/acObj/Line01997=This Hybrid Stasis Cells are very hard and can only be destroyed by Odin. We need to escort the Odin and destroy them before Hybrids wake up.
Conversation/acObj/Line01998=My team is sending out the fuel needed to build the Odin. It takes some time, so preperation time for battle is enough.
Conversation/acObj/Line01999=Odin has finished. Odin will destroy Amon's forces that are blocking the factory.
Conversation/acObj/Line02000=The fuel has arrived. My team starts building the Odin.
Conversation/acObj/Line02001=Odin has departed to destroy the first Hybrid Stasis Cell. Prepare to escort the Odin.
Conversation/acObj/Line02002=Odin has departed to destroy the next Hybrid Stasis Cell. 
Conversation/acObj/Line02003=Odin has departed to destroy the last Hybrid Stasis Cell. Good luck, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line02004=Odin has arrived at the entrance of the first place. My team checks the Odin before departure.
Conversation/acObj/Line02005=Odin has arrived at the entrance of the second place. My team checks the Odin before the next battle.
Conversation/acObj/Line02006=Odin has arrived at the entrance of the last place. My team checks the Odin before the final battle.
Conversation/acObj/Line02007=Displays the location of the first Hybrid Stasis Cell.
Conversation/acObj/Line02008=Odin has destroyed the first Hybrid Stasis Cell. Displays the next location.
Conversation/acObj/Line02009=Odin has destroyed the second Hybrid Stasis Cell. Displays the last location.
Conversation/acObj/Line02010=Amon has sent forces to attack Odin intensively. Strengthen our escorts, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line02011=Amon's forces are attacking Odin.
Conversation/acObj/Line02012=Amon has dealt considerable damage to Odin thus far. Bolster our escorts, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line02013=Odin has suffered significant damage. It can not sustain much more.
Conversation/acObj/Line02014=Odin is nearly destroyed. Do not allow it to be destroyed!
Conversation/acObj/Line02015=We don't know the engine of destruction has been destroyed. We rebuild it as soon as possible.
Conversation/acObj/Line02016=Odin has been rebuilt. The number of rebuilding is limited, so be careful.
Conversation/acObj/Line02017=Commanders, once more Odin has been destroyed, we can't rebuild it anymore. perform the last rebuilding.
Conversation/acObj/Line02018=Odin has been rebuilt. This time is the last chance,
Conversation/acObj/Line02019=Odin is under attack.
Conversation/acObj/Line02020=Beware, commanders! Amon's forces have severely damaged Odin.
Conversation/acObj/Line02021=There are secret weaponry research facilities. If you destroy the gate controller, you can get Odin's additional weapon parts.
Conversation/acObj/Line02022=Crucio! It's a tremendous weapon. It can also attack air units.
Conversation/acObj/Line02023=With one of these, a swarm will be easily overpowered. We install it to the Odin.
Conversation/acObj/Line02024=Great, commanders. we have got all the weapons of Odin.
Conversation/acObj/Line02025=The range of the weapons is not only increated but also any enemy is detected with this parts. It's like a lie, but it's true.
Conversation/acObj/Line02026=It is fortunate to make Amon's operation a failure. In addition, the weaponry has proved successful. Thank you, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line02027=Oh my God... Odin has been completely destroyed. Now we have to face more terrible Hybrids.
