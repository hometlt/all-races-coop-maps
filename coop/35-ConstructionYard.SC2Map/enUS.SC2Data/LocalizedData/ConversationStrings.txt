Conversation/acObj/Line01996=I'm glad to see you, commanders. The Settlement Agria-5 is not only favoured for the residency but also rich in resources, required for maintenance of the Dominion's army.
Conversation/acObj/Line01997=Amon and his followers are trying to drive us out of this planet and get our resource-extraction positions under control. We need to come into six strategic positions in order to strengthen and proceed with the resource extraction.
Conversation/acObj/Line01998=My men will go to our former camps to reestablish the supply system and the extraction of resources. Your aim is firstly to protect the transport with colonists, while they are on the way and only then- rebuilt camps. We all will help you as much as we can however we are unable to push the enemy alone.
Conversation/acObj/Line01999=Don't let two or more means of transport or already rebuilt camps be destroyed, otherwise we will back forces for reestablishing the control under the extraction of resources. All of us count on you, commanders!
Conversation/acObj/Line02000=Commanders. There are two facilities in this area. Bring a ground unit to a facility to send us a signal, then clean up the nearest region from Amon's servants and hold on for reinforcements. We'll be very pleasure for you, if there facilities be our so soon.
Conversation/acObj/Line02001=Good work, commanders! Two facilities belongs to us again! It is good news for our colony!
Conversation/acObj/Line02002=The group of colonists is ready to take the camp.  Commanders, provide the necessary support to them! 
Conversation/acObj/Line02003=The transport is ready to move. Protect it if necessary. 
Conversation/acObj/Line02004=The transport and the team are ready to take the road! Commanders, lend them your support.
Conversation/acObj/Line02005=Well done, commanders. Camp has been established.
Conversation/acObj/Line02006=The camp has been constructed. Prevent it from destruction, until all camps are not placed.
Conversation/acObj/Line02007=Good work, commanders. Construction of camp has been completed.
Conversation/acObj/Line02008=The camp is under attack!
Conversation/acObj/Line02009=Commanders! Help us to stand against this Amons attack!
Conversation/acObj/Line02010=Amon is attacking the camp!
Conversation/acObj/Line02011=Amon have destroyed the camp. All people are dead. 
Conversation/acObj/Line02012=Amon have destroyed the camp! Commanders, why you have not supported them in the fight?
Conversation/acObj/Line02013=The camp has fallen. Those people were in true of your help, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line02014=Amon have destroyed too many camps. It is all for this colony, commanders. The Dark God has won this fight and his servants are rich with resources.
Conversation/acObj/Line02015=It's a great pity, commanders; we have lost too many means of transport and camps. Amon wins; this planet is lost for us. 
Conversation/acObj/Line02016=The transport was destroyed! My men are dead. Watch out, captains.  One more casualty will mean failure.  
Conversation/acObj/Line02017=The transport is destroyed together with its passengers. It is horrible! Captains, can you be unable to help? 
Conversation/acObj/Line02018=Commanders! The transport with the colonists is suffering casualties! The urgent assistance is required!
Conversation/acObj/Line02019=Amon's forces have attacked our transport. If you don't interfere in, it will be lost with all the people inside!
Conversation/acObj/Line02020=Amon's followers have attacked our transport! Hurry up, captains! Protect it from the obliteration!
Conversation/acObj/Line02021=Commanders. Our SCV have moved for constructing a Sensor Tower. Building site have been marked on your map. Ones tower construction is completed, it will be specialy cloaked and Amon's servants will not be able to detect it, even with a detector. Escort an SCV and use this tower as you need.
Conversation/acObj/Line02022=Builders report that they can raise extra protective constructions near some camps. Provide extra protection and my men will manage to settle there down.
Conversation/acObj/Line02023=Amon have pushed us away from here! The facility is lost, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line02024=Oh, no! This facility is lost for us!
Conversation/acObj/Line02025=The facility has fallen. We can't hold against so many enemies.
Conversation/acObj/Line02026=Well done with this facility. We took control of it only with your assistance, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line02027=Control of this facility established. Defensive point deployed.
Conversation/acObj/Line02028=Connection to facility systems established. Well done commanders. It is our's now.
Conversation/acObj/Line02029=Hold on for a few minutes, commanders! Eliminate all Amon's forces near to the facility, so we could capture it and establish a base.
Conversation/acObj/Line02030=Amon is attacking all existing camp! Commanders, these are the last his forces in this sector. Protect the camps for all costs!
