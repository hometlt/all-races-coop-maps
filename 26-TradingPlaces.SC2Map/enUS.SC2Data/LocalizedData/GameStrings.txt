Param/Value/03210D4C=We still have an opportunity to get the data we seek. I have provided a pair of Purifier Wardens to your control, and exposed one of the data cores on the platform. If you can, bring these to the data site, in order to acquire the data that we need, and escort them back to the landing site.

Param/Value/0CB758E1=Feniks Win'thar
Param/Value/0ED0D0B8=Commander, grave news, the power cores are charging the station's shield capacitors. Once they reach they reach full charge, destroying the cores will no longer cause the shields to fail. Each core destroyed will slow the capacitor's from reaching optimum energy levels.

Param/Value/3EB7661F=The wardens are safely back in the shuttle commander, but it appears the data is fragmented. We will scan for another access point.

Param/Value/5A5F5FF3=Entaro Adun commanders. Our plans to acquire data of the hybrid vulnerabilities is in peril. Amon has sealed the facility and his fleet approaches. Destroying the key generators will disable the shields, allowing us to escape before they arrive.
Param/Value/5DB83252=Feniks Win'thar
Param/Value/6081E705=Only one generators remains. There isn't much time, bring the remaining power core offline so we may flee the facility.

Param/Value/752FD483=...Wait. An advance portion of Amon's Fleet has passed into the facility's shields, and is heading for our base. Commander, you must hold out while the warp generators come online.
Param/Value/7D4481F9=Well done commanders, that is the first generator disabled, only two clusters now remain. Make haste to bring the others down. We have detected Amon's fleet entering the system's fringes.
Param/Value/86745D12=Warp generators are active. Congratulations commander.

Param/Value/922D4142=Excellent job commanders. Using both of these data samples, we will be able to reconstruct the technical data we require. Focus now on bringing down those generators, or all will be for naught.
Param/Value/92763CC1=Amon's forces have shielded the power generators. However maintaining the facility's shield array, means that only one core can be protected at a time. I have highlighted the shielded core on your minimap.
