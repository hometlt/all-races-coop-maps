DOCSTR_0003=Greetings commanders! The name's Christopher, mercenary for hire... and lost on this desolate planet.
DOCSTR_0004=Do you know what else is lost? My gear! How about you give me a hand in finding it.
DOCSTR_0005=Wassup commanders!? I've been stuck on this planet for a couple days now, so I appreciate the company.
DOCSTR_0006=By the way, would you mind helping me find my missing gear? It should be in the ruins nearby.
DOCSTR_0007=Ah, the fabled commanders! It's an honor to meet you guys.
DOCSTR_0008=Say, can I ask you a favor? My gear was thrown all over the place when I crashlanded on this planet.
DOCSTR_0009=If you could help me retrieve it, that would be rad!
DOCSTR_0010=
DOCSTR_0011=Coffee break's over guys, we got enemy forces coming this way!
DOCSTR_0012=You must be quite popular, commanders. It seems the enemy is trying to attack your base.
DOCSTR_0013=Watch out guys, some freaks are coming your way!
DOCSTR_0014=
DOCSTR_0015=Hybrid... there are no creatures in the galaxy more dreadful than those. Don't underestimate them!
DOCSTR_0016=Bring out the laser pitchforks guys, the hybrid are on the loose!
DOCSTR_0017=You better pay attention to this, commanders. My sensors show hybrid among the enemy ranks.
DOCSTR_0018=
DOCSTR_0019=The bad guys are trying to destroy my ship? What a bunch of jerks!<n/>Commanders, protect it at all costs!
DOCSTR_0020=Looks like my ship is the enemy's next target.
DOCSTR_0021=Unless you wish to pay for additional repairs, I suggest you protect it while I'm busy over here.
DOCSTR_0022=If you don't protect the ship, it's gonna be destroyed.
DOCSTR_0023=
DOCSTR_0024=I'm detecting a heat signature at this location. Chances are that some of my missing gear can be found there.
DOCSTR_0025=Having an escort to assist me would help a lot. Just saying.
DOCSTR_0026=I'm an unstoppable force of nature... with my gear. Without it, not so much.
DOCSTR_0027=I might need an escort to survive the trip.
DOCSTR_0028=Knowing my luck, I won't be able to retrieve my gear without a fight.
DOCSTR_0029=I need the assistance of your troops, commanders.
DOCSTR_0030=
DOCSTR_0031=I've detected a piece of my missing gear. I'm gonna move out to retrieve it soon.
DOCSTR_0032=I'm searching for my missing gear, anyone wants to join me? You'll get a free hug, too!
DOCSTR_0033=You know the drill. Gather your forces, and prepare for some heavy resistance.
DOCSTR_0034=
DOCSTR_0035=Looks like there's still some life left in these old ruins. Brace yourselves!
DOCSTR_0036=OF COURSE some ancient statue comes to life in this exact moment!<n/>*sigh* It can't be helped, we have to take it down.
DOCSTR_0037=You know, there are a bunch of bad guys all around us. How about we target those first? No? Ok...
DOCSTR_0038=Get your hands-off my gear! I stole it first!
DOCSTR_0039=The bigger they are, the more... intimidating they seem...This is gonna hurt.
DOCSTR_0040=
DOCSTR_0041=Awesome! I knew I could count on you guys!
DOCSTR_0042=Now that was a prime example of teamwork right there!

DOCSTR_0044=Better luck next time, construct!
DOCSTR_0045=
DOCSTR_0046=Oh snap! I totally forgot about my pets!
DOCSTR_0047=If they get hurt, my wife's gonna be sooo mad. Please protect them!

DOCSTR_0062=I can't believe this! How could they? There was no incentive to do that! 
DOCSTR_0063=
DOCSTR_0064=Superbly-done commanders! Now I can repair my ship at last.
DOCSTR_0065=Say, do you have a couple spare fusion reactors lying around, by any chance?
DOCSTR_0066=You did well commanders. I'm sure to recommend you to my fellow mercenary friends.
DOCSTR_0067=That was the last missing piece, commanders. Now I can return home at last.
DOCSTR_0068=I just hope my wife won't notice the scratches on the ship.
DOCSTR_0069=
