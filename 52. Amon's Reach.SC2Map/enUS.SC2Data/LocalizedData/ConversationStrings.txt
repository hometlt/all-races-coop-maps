Conversation/acObj/Line02477=Enemy forces managed to breach the city defenses. They are trying to stop the evacuation by locking launch bays.
Conversation/acObj/Line02478=Evacuation must be completed in order to proceed with activation of Xel'naga Temple. Free this launch bay to allow me to start launching the evacuation ships.
Conversation/acObj/Line02479=I had to shutdown most of the city facilities to stop enemy advance. This Dark Power Cells Network can be used to move your forces around the city. I will give you access to the network, but you will need to activate the other Power Cells yourself.
Conversation/acObj/Line02480=Clear the enemies near the Power Cell and bring your ground forces near it to activate it.
Conversation/acObj/Line02481=This bridge was disabled to separate enemy forces, but I have lost connection to it. Destroy this Null Circuit to activate the bridge if you need it.
Conversation/acObj/Line02482=Enemy used this Warp Conduit to get around the city defense lines. I was able to lock it fast, but enemy has summoned Void Corruption Crystal and trying to break the lock. Stop them if you can.
Conversation/acObj/Line02483=Void Corruption is dispersing and the lock is still active, I will continue to monitor it's condition.
Conversation/acObj/Line02484=Lock has been breached and this Warp Conduit is active again. But I am not detecting enemy presence from the other side, for now.
Conversation/acObj/Line02485=The evacuation is in progress. But gathering people from around the city to this one launch bay will take too much time. You must free other launch bays to speed up the evacuation.
Conversation/acObj/Line02486=The enemy is trying to lock this launch bay again! You must stop them!
Conversation/acObj/Line02487=Enemy is building a base here, defense lines on this side will stop enemy reinforcements, but I can not stop forces produced in this base from reaching the Warp Conduit. Do not allow them to destroy it!
Conversation/acObj/Line02488=A few hybrids managed to breach the barrier here, they are going after the Warp Conduit! You must stop them at once!
Conversation/acObj/Line02489=Defense lines are starting to wear down, more hybrids managed to break through!
Conversation/acObj/Line02490=The city defenses is at it's limit! A huge number of hybrids have managed to break through and they are heading for the Warp Conduit!
Conversation/acObj/Line02491=The hybrids are trying to break the lock on this Warp Conduit from the other side. It will not last for long, complete the evacuation before they arrive!
Conversation/acObj/Line02492=I am detecting hybrids presence on the other side of this Warp Conduit, soon they will be here. Complete the evacuation before they arrive!
