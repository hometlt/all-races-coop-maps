Conversation/acObj/Line01997=Commanders, Amon's forces are after our unique warp disruption tech.
Conversation/acObj/Line01998=This tech suspends in stasis anything that attempts to warp into this area.
Conversation/acObj/Line02000=What we need you to do is quickly dismantle our decrepit power plants before they break down, so we can rebuild them with more modern tech.
Conversation/acObj/Line02001=There's also a bit of a complication. Destroying a power plant will destabilize the disruption field, making us temporarily vulnerable to enemy warp-ins.
Conversation/acObj/Line02003=We've lost another construction unit. Initiate clean slate protocol!
Conversation/acObj/Line02004=We've lost another power plant. Initiate clean slate protocol!
Conversation/acObj/Line02005=We've lost a construction unit. If this happens again, we're going to lose this facility in a hurry.
Conversation/acObj/Line02006=We've lost a power plant. If this happens again, we're going to lose this facility in a hurry.
Conversation/acObj/Line02008=On the bright side, the energy readings are more stable than predicted, so we still have some time.
Conversation/acObj/Line02009=Power output is showing stable. We can take our time replacing the remaining power plants. Thanks for your help, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line02010=Now hold that position while we rebuild the power plant. Destroying it destabilized the warp disruption field, so be wary of hostile forces.
Conversation/acObj/Line02011=Good, you got it dismantled. We're cutting it close, but we'll get this power plant replaced in time.
Conversation/acObj/Line02012=Also, the energy readings are more stable than predicted, so we still have some time.
Conversation/acObj/Line02013=We're out of time. We have to dispatch the construction unit now or we'll be too late, so please destroy the old power plant before it arrives.
Conversation/acObj/Line02014=We're out of time. We have to dispatch the construction units now or we'll be too late, so please destroy the old power plants before they arrive.
Conversation/acObj/Line02015=Countdown activated. That's the longest we can wait to dispatch a construction unit.
Conversation/acObj/Line02016=If you're ready, go ahead and take out that first power plant so we can get it replaced.
Conversation/acObj/Line02017=Our construction units are on standby, so head to the next site whenever you're ready.
Conversation/acObj/Line02018=Amon's army is bound to attack in full force, so be on guard.
Conversation/acObj/Line02019=This is the final and highest-output power plant in the area, commanders. It's going to leave the biggest gap in our coverage while it's out of commission.
Conversation/acObj/Line02020=The next two power plants are on a serial circuit, so taking one down disconnects the other from the system.
Conversation/acObj/Line02021=These two are also on a serial circuit. Remember, it's best to replace these at the same time, and both construction units will be have to be dispatched when the countdown reaches zero.
Conversation/acObj/Line02022=If you don't dismantle the old power plant before it arrives, the whole system is bound to collapse, and then the situation's hopeless.
Conversation/acObj/Line02023=Remember, don't let Amon's forces overrun that area. More of the hostiles trapped by the warp disruption have been released.
Conversation/acObj/Line02024=Keep your eyes on the construction site.
Conversation/acObj/Line02025=The warp disruption field has destabilized again. Keep that construction site safe.
Conversation/acObj/Line02027=We've accounted for travel and construction in the countdown, but we still need to send out both construction units before the countdown reaches zero.
Conversation/acObj/Line02028=Not good, commanders. A void thrasher got through during the last bit of down time, and it's assaulting our warp disruptor.
Conversation/acObj/Line02029=I'm confident we can get some shields up within a few minutes and before it takes too much damage, but it'd really help us out if you could take point and destroy it before then.
Conversation/acObj/Line02030=Luckily, the debris from the old power plant seems to have closed the circuit, so we'll still get the benefit of the other one in that series.
Conversation/acObj/Line02034=This is the last one we need. Don't let anything halt the construction.
Conversation/acObj/Line02035=But there's a bit of a complication. Destroying a power plant will destabilize the disruption field, making us temporarily vulnerable to enemy warp-ins.
Conversation/acObj/Line02036=Time's running low.
Conversation/acObj/Line02037=We're running out of time.
Conversation/acObj/Line02038=There's not much time left on the clock.
