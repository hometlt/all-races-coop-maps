Conversation/BurningSwarmConversation/Line00001=Thank you for responding to our call. It seems Amon is creating new Hybrid KRONOS to bring Zerg Swarm under its control.
Conversation/BurningSwarmConversation/Line00001/Speaker=Naktul
Conversation/BurningSwarmConversation/Line00003=The Spawning ground incubating Zerg Swarms to face Amon is in danger.
Conversation/BurningSwarmConversation/Line00004=Please keep the eggs as many as possible if you have a time.
Conversation/BurningSwarmConversation/Line00005=You cannot destroy me. I shall rise again.
Conversation/BurningSwarmConversation/Line00007=You did great job! Only half of them are left.
Conversation/BurningSwarmConversation/Line00008=KRONOS is going to wake soon! Stand against it!
Conversation/BurningSwarmConversation/Line00008/Speaker=Naktul
Conversation/BurningSwarmConversation/Line00011=Merely a temporary setback.
Conversation/BurningSwarmConversation/Line00013=KRONOS will revive soon. Be careful!
Conversation/BurningSwarmConversation/Line00016=KRONOS is going to come back. Focus on your defence!
Conversation/BurningSwarmConversation/Line00019=Your doom is only delayed.
Conversation/BurningSwarmConversation/Line00021="IT" will come again.
Conversation/BurningSwarmConversation/Line00024=Enjoy your fleeting victory. This is not over.

Conversation/BurningSwarmConversation/Line00026=You did great job. Only half of them are left.
Conversation/BurningSwarmConversation/Line00027=Last one! Do your best, Commander.
Conversation/BurningSwarmConversation/Line00028=All the Towers of Void are destroyed!
Conversation/BurningSwarmConversation/Line00029=All of your structures have been destroyed. Maybe we should find another way.
Conversation/BurningSwarmConversation/Line00030=Amon finally dominates all of the Zerg Swarms in Char!
Conversation/BurningSwarmConversation/Line00031=KRONOS has been overloaded!
Conversation/BurningSwarmConversation/Line00032=Amon's army is attacking the Spawning ground! Protect them!
Conversation/BurningSwarmConversation/Line00033=Zerg Swarms have hatched out well. They will be helpful to stand against Amon.
Conversation/BurningSwarmConversation/Line00034=We have lost too many eggs. Don't bother with it, and concentrate on KRONOS.
Conversation/BurningSwarmConversation/Line00035=It seems that Amon will send army to Spawning Ground! Bring your troops to here!
Conversation/BurningSwarmConversation/Line00036=I've just detected a number of Overloads! Prepare your air defence.
Conversation/BurningSwarmConversation/Line00039=The Spawning ground incubating Zerg Swarms to face Amon is in danger.
Conversation/BurningSwarmConversation/Line00041=Four Tower of Voids are supplying Void Energy to KRONOS, getting stronger. Your main objective is to destroy all of Towers and kill KRONOS.

Conversation/BurningSwarmConversation/Line00060=KRONOS has been detected!
Conversation/BurningSwarmConversation/Line00061=Warning! KRONOS has commenced its attack.
Conversation/BurningSwarmConversation/Line00063=I come for you NOW. Prepare for DEATH.
Conversation/BurningSwarmConversation/Line00065=KRONOS backoff. Focus on destroying Towers of Void.
Conversation/BurningSwarmConversation/Line00067=Your lives are FORFREIT. Surrender to DESPAIR.
Conversation/BurningSwarmConversation/Line00069=You should clear main objective before KRONOS revives again!
Conversation/BurningSwarmConversation/Line00071=Your existence ENDS this day.
Conversation/BurningSwarmConversation/Line00073=It is getting more difficult to deal with it. You need to hurry.
Conversation/BurningSwarmConversation/Line00075=CEASE your follish struggle. There is no HOPE.
Conversation/BurningSwarmConversation/Line00077=We don't have much time! KRONOS will gain full energy soon!
