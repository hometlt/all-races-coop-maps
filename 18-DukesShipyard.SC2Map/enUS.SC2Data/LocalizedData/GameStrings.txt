Button/Tooltip/CapitalShip=Powerful Terran Battlecruisers under General Hammond Duke's command. Unfortunately, this ship was heavily damaged in Moebius' attack. It had returned to the shipyard for repairs when Moebius assaulted the platform.
Button/Tooltip/GehennaCruiser=Gigantic Terran Battlecruiser of impressive power. This particular one was docked at the shipyards for Hammond Duke, but the message didn't reach him before Moebius took control of the platform. Strange how they haven't taken it for themselves.

Character/Attitude/HammondDuke=Strict, stubborn, and short tempered
Character/Description/HammondDuke=Hammond Duke is a 30 year old general of the Terran Dominion. By present time he has been promoted to general of a sizable patrol of capital ships stationed on a platform orbiting around the planet Char.<n/>Some might say he was inspired by General Edmund Duke. Others may say "inspired" is an understatement.

DocInfo/DescLong=General Hammond Duke has requested assistence in repelling Moebius forces. Unfortunately, Moebius has already taken the shipyard by the time you have arrived. Help General Duke reclaim his fleet currently grounded on the platform.<n/><n/>ALL RACES COOP<n/>Discord server: https://discord.gg/mhuCV3cT
