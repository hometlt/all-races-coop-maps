Conversation/acObj/Line01996=I'd appreciate your support, commanders. Amon's Saboteurs have paralyzed our power System. Even now, their fleet in high orbit keeps attacking our ship with aerolites.
Conversation/acObj/Line01997=Though our shield generators on Cybros could provide protection from these attacks, their power supplies are all suspended by now.
Conversation/acObj/Line01998=You'll have to activate shield generators with mobile power sources before we could finish the emergency reboot of the core matrix.
Conversation/acObj/Line01999=Amon's aerolite attack has destroyed a photonic anchor. The photonic anchor is made of pure solar crystal. We could take its remaining pieces to activate shield generators.
Conversation/acObj/Line02000=Order your workers to collect solar crystals. You may afterwards bring them to shield generators to prevent upcoming aerolites.
Conversation/acObj/Line02001=Memory lattice totally corrupted. This Megalith is under Amon's hand…
Conversation/acObj/Line02002=The corruption rooted too deeply. This Megalith is lost. 
Conversation/acObj/Line02003=Well done commanders, we will send probes to reformat Megalith.
Conversation/acObj/Line02004=Well done commanders, we will send probes to reformat Megalith.
Conversation/acObj/Line02005=Another Megalith shows signs of infection, commanders. Neutralize it before it's too late.
Conversation/acObj/Line02006=A Megalith is infected with a virus by Amon's Saboteurs. You will have to paralyze it before its memory lattice is totally corrupted.
Conversation/acObj/Line02007=Cybros is disintegrating, abandon the ship! You failed, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line02008=Purifier will reexamine our covenant, commanders. You lose our faith.
Conversation/acObj/Line02009=We can no longer control the damage, we lose Cybros, Amon wins…
Conversation/acObj/Line02010=Purifiers' regards, commanders! From now on, they'll fight beside you.
Conversation/acObj/Line02011=Core matrix charging complete. The main battery of Cybros will purify the fallens. By fire be purged!
Conversation/acObj/Line02012=Very impressive, commanders. You have foiled Amon's scheme. Cybros is saved!
Conversation/acObj/Line02013=Make good use of solar crystals, commander. Cybros must not fall.
Conversation/acObj/Line02014=Excellent, extra solar crystals provide us tactical advantages  considerably.
Conversation/acObj/Line02015=The loss of photonic anchors is surely a pity, however there is no time to mourn. Sacrifices are needed for the greater good.
Conversation/acObj/Line02016=These small animals occupied the engine cooling pond after Cybros had awaken from stasis. They're seemingly harmless...and cute.
Conversation/acObj/Line02017=Cybros is taking heavy damage! She cannot afford any of those attacks again!
Conversation/acObj/Line02018=Multiple subsystems shutting down. Should the ship be hit again, she will surely sink. Ruin this no more, commanders!
Conversation/acObj/Line02019=An aerolite has fallen upon Cybros. You must not make this happen again!
Conversation/acObj/Line02020=An aerolite has made its way through your defenses, commanders. You must activate the shield before they land.
Conversation/acObj/Line02021=Core matrix reboot is almost done! Power system is about to restored.
Conversation/acObj/Line02022=Core matrix reboot currently 50 percents. Hold on, commanders!
Conversation/acObj/Line02023=The sensor has detected an upcoming wave of aerolites. Be ready, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line02024=High-speed objects incoming. Prepare to activate the wide area shield.
Conversation/acObj/Line02025=Multiple gigantic aerolites detected, commanders. Do not let them hit the ship.
Conversation/acObj/Line02026=There are more photonic anchors elsewhere on Cybros. Deconstruct them to gain more solar crystals.
Conversation/acObj/Line02027=Aerolites approaching. Time is running out, commanders!
Conversation/acObj/Line02028=You have one minute left, commanders. Attack if you are ready.
Conversation/acObj/Line02029=Aerolites are heading towards your location, commanders. Take cover!
Conversation/acObj/Line02030=Amon launched rains of aerolites above. Look for the shelter of wide area shield!
Conversation/acObj/Line02031=The sensor has detected mass aerolites! Your troops need protection. Move them to the shield!
Conversation/acObj/Line02032=A Hybrid Dominator appears on the battlefield. It will drain energy from solar crystals. Prevent this from happening!
Conversation/acObj/Line02037=Attention! A Hybrid dominator is approaching the shield generators. Purify this fallen creature!
Conversation/acObj/Line02042=Hybrid Dominator is able to drain energy from solar crystals. Protect shield generators.
